Edit is a free (GPL3) text editor. It is currently in early alpha stages - the following planned
functionality is not yet implemented:
	- Syntax Highlighting
 - Tabbed Editors

=== FEATURES ===
 - Writing on text
 - Saving files
 - Basic cursor movement
 - Save, Exit, and Exit without saving

=== KNOWN BUGS ===
 - Cursor movement up and down does not preserve column position

=== BUILD SETTINGS ===
DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE is the size the buffer is initialized to. If the file size is already
greater than half of this value, this value will be added to the file size and used for the
buffer size.

ENABLE_COLORS is whether or not colors should be enabled. It is recommended to leave this
at zero for slow terminals and SSH connections.

=== USAGE INSTRUCTIONS ===
Type like you would a normal text editor. To use any of the menu items on the top bar, press and release
Esc, and then press and release the highlighed letter for that item.
