Edit is a free (GPL3) text editor inspired by the MS-DOS editor.
It is currently in early alpha stages - the following planned
functionality is not yet implemented:
	- File and Edit menus
	- Syntax Highlighting

=== FEATURES ===
- Writing on text
- Saving files
- Basic cursor movement

=== KNOWN BUGS ===
- Cursor movement up and down does not preserve column position

=== BUILD SETTINGS ===
DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE is the size the buffer is initialized to. If the file size is already
greater than half of this value, this value will be added to the file size and used for the
buffer size.

ENABLE_COLORS is whether or not colors should be enabled. It is recommended to leave this
at zero for slow terminals and SSH connections.
